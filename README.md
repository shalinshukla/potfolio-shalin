# I have divided my work in three categories and each has one example module in it

# 1. custom solution - it has one module name app_step_form - it is a personalized developed solution so might require 
# some file to run the entire execution which I can not provide under NDA, so it can help check my coding style and patters.

# 2 My Drupal org modules: In this I did contrib few modules and here is the link as well as module is available under folder
# https://www.drupal.org/project/cookie_block - It will help user to set the block and show hide from backend with different cookie and its value
# https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_anonymous_submission - It will give option to disable the tracking for IP for the submission.

# 3. Production ready module: It has a module which can directly be used over any working site
# Linkex - it gives support in link field to add files from IMCE manager which will make it easy to link any PDF and files
